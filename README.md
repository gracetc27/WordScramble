# WordScramble 
Project 5 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app introduces more key Swift and SwiftUI tools like List and using Bundle. 
This is a simple word game where users try to make as many words from a prompt word as possible. The words they input are validated.
# Features
- Introduces List.
- Loads resources from the app bundle.
- Dives deeper into strings.
- Uses UItextChecker to validate user input.
